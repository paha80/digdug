## About <a name = "about"></a>

This repo is all about my learning and testing C and Python languages and using VS Code. I have some background on making stuff (apps & games can be found from [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/fi/developer/pasi-hanninen/id1039531209) and [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/fi/app/classic-color-solitaire/id1456398990?l=fi&mt=12)) using mainly Swift and Objective-C (XCode), but also GML (Game Maker), and some other stuff using C# (Visual Studio), Java (Eclipse) and JavaScript (WebStorm).
